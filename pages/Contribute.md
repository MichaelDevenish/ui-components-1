### Contribute to the Wiki

Any addition to this WIKI should be added through pull requests against the `wiki` branch. This orphan branch
is an alternative to having a completely separate repository to host the wiki’s content.

Once merged, the content of the `wiki` branch will automatically be forced pushed to SPA’s `wiki` repository (git@github.com:intellihr/spa.wiki.git). 
Any manual changes made to wiki through Github’s interface or else will be overwritten when the `wiki` branch gets updated.

If required a description of the change should be added to the pull request to introduce the changes.
