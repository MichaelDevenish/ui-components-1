The following guidelines for writing copy are intended to create a consistent style and voice for the intelliHR product.

## Language
* **Keep text short and simple** to make text accessible to people of all backgrounds
    * **Do**: This person doesn't have a job record
    * **Don't**: This individual whose digital profile you are viewing does not appear to have a job record

* **Use industry standard proper nouns** as feature names
    * **Do**:  Private Notes
    * **Don't**: Diary Notes

* **Use a friendly tone and avoid niceties** to appear more conversational
    * **Do**:  Nice! You've completed all of your outstanding tasks.
    * **Don't**: Task completed successfully. All outstanding tasks have been completed.

* **Use contractions** to sound more natural
    * **Do**: You can't delete an active goal
    * **Don't**: You cannot delete an active goal

* **When to use 'My' and 'Your'**
    * **You/Your**: When asking questions, giving instructions, or describing things to the user. Imagine writing from the perspective of a personal assistant.
    * **Me/My**: When the user is interacting with the product on things like buttons- ONLY if absolutely necessary for clarity. _First person is not preferred._

* **Dates**
    * **Do**: Always respect the user's shorthand date format (DD/MM/YY, MM/DD/YY, YY/MM/DD, etc.)
    * **Do**: Use `d MMM YYYY` (eg: 7 Jul 1977) in contexts where a more conversational date is required

* **Use input agnostic language** where possible instead of input specific terminology
    * **Do**: Pick your preferred email address
    * **Don't**: Click on your preferred email address

* **Action words should follow the following rules** 
    * **Create/Delete**: When a user will be creating/deleting a system object like a Self-Service Action, Pulse, or Person
    * **Add/Remove**: When a user is adding/removing additional data to a system object like a Phone Number to a Person, or Measurements to a Goal
    * **Update**: When a user is editing a system object
    * **Exceptions**: Occasionally there will be more context appropriate action words such as `Set Goal` and `Issue Task` which are preferred to the above. The appropriate destructive action word should still be used.
    * **Page Titles and Submit Buttons**: For titles and buttons, use the following format `[Action Name] [System Object Name]`. For example: `Create Person`, `Add Phone Number`, `Set Goal`. On edit forms the submit button should always be `Save`
    * **Don't**: Use the word `new` on creation actions. It is implied.

## Capitalization and Punctuation
* **Use Title Case for buttons, page titles, menu items, and labels** most words are capitalized
    * **Example**: Expected Start/End Date
    * **Example**: Set a Goal
    * **Example**: Check-in Now
    * **Example**: Create a Self-Service Action Tile
    * **Do**: Capitalize all words except articles (“a,” “an,” “the”) and short prepositions (“to,” “on,” “at,” “by,” “from”) which should only be capitalized if they are the first or last word (eg: 'A Goal')

* **Use Sentence Case for descriptions, help text, and anything conversational** most words are lowercase
    * **Example**: You haven't completed any training in the last quarter.
    * **Do**: Only capitalize the first word of the text element, as well as any proper nouns.

* **Explain acronyms at the first instance on the page** when using acronyms
    * **Example**: Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

* **Use serial (Oxford) commas** for clarity in lists
    * **Do**: The Performance Improvement page features all of your skills, goals, and training records
    * **Don't**: The Performance Improvement page features all of your skills, goals and training records

* **Numbers should always be digits** to make text easier to scan
    * **Do**: You have 27 outstanding tasks
    * **Don't**: You have twenty-seven outstanding tasks
